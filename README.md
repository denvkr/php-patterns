#Design Patterns in PHP
A design pattern in architecture and computer science is a formal way of documenting a solution to a design problem in
a particular field of expertise.

### Creational
* [FactoryMethod](creational/factoryMethod) Creates an instance of several derived classes
* [Abstract Factory](creational/abstractFactory) Creates an instance of several families of classes
* [Singleton](creational/singleton) A class of which only a single instance can exist
* [Builder](creational/builder) Separates object construction from its representation

### [Structural](structural)
* [Adapter](structural/adapter) Converts one interface to another so that it matches what the client is expecting
* [Bridge](structural/bridge) Separates an object’s interface from its implementation
* [Decorator](structural/decorator) Dynamically adds responsibility to the interface by wrapping the original code
* [Facade](structural/facade) Provides a simplified interface
