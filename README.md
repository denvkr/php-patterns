#Design Patterns in PHP
A design pattern in architecture and computer science is a formal way of documenting a solution to a design problem in
a particular field of expertise.

### Creational
* [FactoryMethod](creational/factoryMethod) Creates an instance of several derived classes
* [Abstract Factory](creational/abstractFactory) Creates an instance of several families of classes
* [Singleton](creational/singleton) A class of which only a single instance can exist
* [Builder](creational/builder) Separates object construction from its representation
* [Prototype](creational/prototype) Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
* Lazy initialization
* Multiton
* Object pool
* Resource acquisition is initialization

### [Structural](structural)
* [Adapter](structural/adapter) Converts one interface to another so that it matches what the client is expecting
* [Bridge](structural/bridge) Separates an object’s interface from its implementation
* [Decorator](structural/decorator) Dynamically adds responsibility to the interface by wrapping the original code
* [Facade](structural/facade) Provides a simplified interface
* [Proxy](structural/proxy) Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
* [Composite](structural/composite) Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
* [Flyweight](structural/flyweight) Use sharing to support large numbers of similar objects efficiently
* Front Controller
* Module
* Twin

### Behavioral
* Interpreter
* Observer
* Command
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Memento
* State
* Chain of Responsibility
* Strategy
* Template Method
* Visitor
* Null object
* Specification
* Servant

###Domain Logic Patterns
* Transaction Script
* Domain Model
* Table Module
* Service Layer

###Data Source Architectural Patterns
* Table Data Gateway
* Row Data Gateway
* Active Record
* Data Mapper

###Object-Relational Behavioral Patterns
* Unit of Work
* Identity Map
* Lazy Load

###Object-Relational Structural Patterns
* Identity Field
* Foreign Key Mapping
* Association Table Mapping
* Dependent Mapping
* Embedded Value
* Serialized LOB
* Single Table Inheritance
* Class Table Inheritance
* Concrete Table Inheritance
* Inheritance Mappers

###Object-Relational Metadata Mapping Patterns
* Metadata Mapping
* Query Object
* Repository

###Web Presentation Patterns
* Model View Controller
* Page Controller
* Front Controller
* Template View
* Transform View
* Two Step View
* Application Controller

###Distribution Patterns
* Remote Facade
* Data Transfer Object

###Offline Concurrency Patterns
* Optimistic Offline Lock
* Pessimistic Offline Lock
* Coarse-Grained Lock
* Implicit Lock

###Session State Patterns
* Client Session State
* Server Session State
* Database Session State

###Base Patterns
* Gateway
* Mapper
* Layer Supertype
* Separated Interface
* Registry
* Value Object
* Money
* Special Case
* Plugin
* Service Stub
* Record Set
