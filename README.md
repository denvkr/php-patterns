#Design Patterns in PHP
I collect the best examples of [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) in PHP.
Every pattern have file index.php with examples and diagrams (draw in [Dia](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia)).
I think this is better than big description.

### Creational
* [Factory Method](creational/factoryMethod) Creates an instance of several derived classes
* [Abstract Factory](creational/abstractFactory) Creates an instance of several families of classes
* [Singleton](creational/singleton) A class of which only a single instance can exist
* [Builder](creational/builder) Separates object construction from its representation
* [Prototype](creational/prototype) Creates new objects by copying this prototype

### [Structural](structural)
* [Adapter](structural/adapter) Converts one interface to another so that it matches what the client is expecting
* [Bridge](structural/bridge) Separates an object’s interface from its implementation
* [Decorator](structural/decorator) Dynamically adds responsibility to the interface by wrapping the original code
* [Facade](structural/facade) Provides a simplified interface
* [Proxy](structural/proxy) Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it
* [Composite](structural/composite) Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies
* [Flyweight](structural/flyweight) Use sharing to support large numbers of similar objects efficiently

### Behavioral
* [Interpreter](behavioral/interpreter) That specifies how to evaluate sentences in a language
* [Observer](behavioral/observer) A way of notifying change to a number of classes
* [Command](behavioral/command) Encapsulate a command request as an object
* [Iterator](behavioral/iterator) Sequentially access the elements of a collection
* [Mediator](behavioral/mediator) Defines simplified communication between classes
* [Memento](behavioral/memento) Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state
* [State](behavioral/state) Encapsulate varying behavior for the same routine based on an object's state object
* [Chain of Responsibility](behavioral/chainOfResponsibility) A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
* [Strategy](behavioral/strategy) Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
* [Template Method](behavioral/templateMethod) Defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in a method
* [Visitor](behavioral/visitor) Is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates.
* [Null object](behavioral/nullObject) Designed to act as a default value of an object

###Web Presentation Patterns
* [Model View Controller](webPresentation/mvc) Divides a given software application into three interconnected part
* [Front Controller](webPresentation/frontController) A controller that handles all requests

###Base Patterns
* [Money](base/money) Represents a monetary value

###More
* [Registry](more/registry) A global object that other objects can use to find common objects
